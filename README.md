A medical report for iron deficiency anemia typically includes blood test results that show:
Low hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A normal range for men is 13.2–16.6 grams per deciliter (g/dL) of blood, and for women it's 11.6–15 g/dL. 
Low hematocrit
Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells in your blood. A normal range for adult women is 35.5–44.9%, and for adult men it's 38.3–48.6%. 
Low ferritin
Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. A normal range is 30–300 ng/mL, with a mean of 88 ng/mL for men and 49 ng/mL for women. 
Low serum iron
A normal range for serum iron varies between individuals and depends on sex. For women, a score below 26 mcg/dL is low, and for men it's below 76 mcg/dL. 
Other tests that may be ordered include: total iron-binding capacity, transferrin, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear. 
A doctor may also perform a physical exam to check for signs of iron deficiency anemia, such as:
Pale skin, gums, or nail beds
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Rapid or uneven breathing
Enlarged liver or spleen
